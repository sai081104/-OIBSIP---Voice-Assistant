# 🎙️ Voice Assistant

Hey there! 👋  
This is a simple **Voice Assistant** project I built as part of my **Python Programming Internship** with **Oasis Infobyte**. It listens to your voice input, fetches data from Wikipedia, and speaks the answer back using text-to-speech.

---

## 🚀 What It Does

- Takes **voice input** from the user  
- Processes speech to text using **SpeechRecognition**  
- Uses **Wikipedia** API to fetch summary info  
- Responds using **pyttsx3** text-to-speech engine  
- Runs in a loop until you say “exit” or “stop”

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** 
  - `speech_recognition`  
  - `pyttsx3`  
  - `wikipedia`
